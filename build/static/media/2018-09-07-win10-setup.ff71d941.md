I used to work on a Mac and don't bother configuring for Deep Learning. However, as Windows is not supported by **nvidia_docker**, I had to find a way.
Here is my new Deep Learning development setup on Windows 10.

We'll cover how to set up:

1. Windows Subsystem for Linux
2. Zsh and Oh My Zsh
3. A pretty terminal with Hyper.Js
4. Deep Learning environment

## WSL

### Kesako?

Recently, Microsoft has put a lot of effort into attracting developers on Windows and as a consequence, they released **Windows Subsystem for Linux**. It enables to run most common command-line tools, utilities, and applications directly on Windows without the overhead of a virtual machine.

### Installation

To begin with, the Windows Subsystem for Linux feature needs to be enabled via a Powershell prompt as an administrator:

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

Reboot your computer.

Then, since Fall Creators Update you can directly install a Linux distro via Microsoft Store.

You'll find more detailed instructions on the Microsoft [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/wsl/install-win10). For this tutorial, I have chosen Ubuntu 16.04.

## Oh My Zsh

### Install Zsh

To begin with, install zsh via the command line:

```shell
sudo apt-get install zsh
```

then set it as your default shell by inserting at the top of `~/.bashrc` :

```shell
bash -c zsh
```

Get rid of your host description by adding at the top of your `~/.zshrc` :

```shell
DEFAULT_USER=`whoami`
```

### Install Oh My Zsh

You can get Oh My Zsh with this command:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

You can install plugins for your own comfort like autocompletion for Docker, Git via `~/.zshrc`. I use the agnoster theme.

## Hyper.js

### Install Hyper.js

The program can be downloaded from the [official website](https://hyper.is/).
I applied the **verminal** theme by adding `plugins: ['verminal']` in the preferences (`ctrl + ,`),
and after installing some [Mono font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono) I add:

```json
verminal: {
    fontFamily: "UbuntuMono NF",
    fontSize: 14
}
```

Finally, edit the shell path in config by setting `shell: 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\bash.exe'`.

### Prettify the output

Here is a little trick[^1] to prettify the output, because it is quite ugly by default.
Add the following to your `~/.zshrc`:

```shell
#Change ls colours
LS_COLORS="ow=01;36;40" && export LS_COLORS

#make cd use the ls colors
zstyle ':completion:\*' list-colors "${(@s.:.)LS_COLORS}"
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```

## Deep Learning environment

### Anaconda

To begin with, you need to create a Python environment via Anaconda.
Go the official [website](<(https://www.anaconda.com/download/)>) and download the Anaconda 64-bit installer for Windows.

Once installed, you can open the Anaconda Prompt to update conda (`conda update conda`) and basic packages (`conda update --all`). You can easily create a new `deep_learning` environment and install the packages you want (like numpy, scipy, tensorflow, tensorflow-gpu, keras, Pillow).

### CUDA Toolkit

Download Cuda Toolkit 9.2 via [Nvidia website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).

![Download CUDA](/blog-images/win10-setup/cuda.png "Download CUDA")

Note that depending on how old you GPU is, you might need to install an older version of CUDA.

### cuDNN

In order to download the final piece, you need to sign up for [Nvidia Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download). Agree to the terms, and download _cuDNN v7.2.1 Library for Windows 10_ or whatever version dedicated to the version of CUDA you downloaded.

### It's time to test!

Copy the Python [script](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py) from Keras example concerning MNIST dataset and verify the output, it should use your GPU and take between 15-20 sec per epoch.

## Final words

Now you're good to go!
Let me know if you found it useful or if you have any questions.
