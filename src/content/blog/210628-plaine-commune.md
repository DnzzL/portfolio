## Press Release

Proud to announce our cooperation with the City of Paris and Fondation Abbé Pierre [^1] to collect data regarding the application of rent controls. The goal of this partnership is to increase the volume of ads we save and provide relevant stats about the locations where the regulation is not applied properly.

## New cities supported!

Plaine commune, composed of Aubervilliers, Épinay-sur-Seine, L’Île-Saint-Denis, La Courneuve, Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, Saint-Denis, Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, Stains et Villetaneuse, has decided putting into place rent control like in Paris, starting June 2021.

After a few mails, we managed to get the necessary files so that our extension [Encadrement-loyers](https://www.encadrement-loyers.fr) is compatible with rent search within these cities.

Looking forward for the next ones!
