In my journey through the world of frontend development, I've found a stack that truly resonates with me: Nuxt 3, Nuxt UI, and Supabase. This combination offers an unmatched developer experience (DX) that I believe sets a new standard for modern web development.

# Nuxt 3: The Ultimate Framework

Nuxt 3 has become my go-to framework for several compelling reasons:

1. **Best-in-Class Documentation**: The documentation is comprehensive, clear, and always up-to-date. It's a rare gem in the tech world where documentation is often an afterthought.

2. **TypeScript Excellence**: The TypeScript support in Nuxt 3 is nothing short of exceptional. The type inference between backend routes and frontend components is seamless, making development both safer and more efficient.

3. **Easy Configuration**: Setting up a new project is a breeze. The default configuration works beautifully out of the box, and when you need to customize, it's intuitive and well-documented.

4. **Extensibility**: Thanks to the UNJS ecosystem, Nuxt 3 is incredibly flexible. You can plug a different runtime or storage without getting bogged down in complex configuration.

# Nuxt UI: Modern Design Made Simple

Nuxt UI has evolved into a powerhouse of modern web design:

1. **Tailwind 4 Support**: Being at the forefront of CSS framework adoption shows the team's commitment to staying current.

2. **Great Defaults**: The components come with sensible defaults that work well out of the box, while still being highly customizable.

3. **Easy Configuration**: Customizing components is straightforward, thanks to Nuxt's excellent type system and intuitive API.

While Shadcn-vue is a strong contender, Nuxt UI's tight integration with the Nuxt ecosystem and contribution from major developers gives it a slight edge in my book.

# The Perfect Stack: Nuxt + Supabase + TanStack Query

After experimenting with various combinations, I've settled on this stack for its simplicity and power:

1. **Nuxt 3**: Provides the foundation with its excellent TypeScript support and developer experience.

2. **Supabase**: Offers a robust backend-as-a-service solution that integrates seamlessly with Nuxt. It's still PostgresQL at its core, but edge functions and auth out of the box is valuable. I'd use drizzle with Better Auth and Postgres if I had to do it myself.

3. **TanStack Query**: Handles data fetching and caching with ease, working perfectly with both Nuxt and Supabase.

4. **Nuxt UI**: Ties everything together with beautiful, consistent components.

This combination offers an unmatched developer experience because:

1. **Minimal Configuration**: Everything just works out of the box.

2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript integration throughout the stack ensures type safety and better development experience.

3. **Performance**: The combination of Nuxt's static site generation capabilities and Supabase's efficient data handling results in fast, responsive applications.

4. **Developer Joy**: The stack is designed to make development enjoyable rather than a chore.

# Conclusion

Sometimes you feel left out when you're not using React or Next.js but the Vue ecosystem is growing fast and offers a lot of value.
The combination of Nuxt 3, Nuxt UI, Supabase, and TanStack Query has become my go-to stack for new projects. The developer experience is unparalleled, and the resulting applications are both performant and maintainable.

If you're looking to build modern web applications without the usual headaches, I highly recommend giving this stack a try. You might just find yourself falling in love with the Vue ecosystem as I have.
