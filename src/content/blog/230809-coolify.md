In the ever-evolving landscape of side project development, adaptability and cost-efficiency are key. For years, **Heroku served as my go-to platform** for deploying and managing my side projects. Its simplicity and generous free tier made it a favorite among developers. However, the winds of change brought about a shift in Heroku's pricing model, and it was time to explore new options. That's when I stumbled upon [Coolify](https://coolify.io/), a platform that not only solved my deployment challenges but also simplified the administration of my apps on a single server instance, offering a more robust, up-to-date, and reliable user interface compared to Dokku.

# The end of an era

Heroku and I had a good run. Its user-friendly interface and "git push heroku master" deployment command made the initial setup of my side projects a breeze. **Heroku's free tier was a sweet deal**, perfect for someone like me who enjoys tinkering with side projects but doesn't want to break the bank. However, the romance soured when Heroku made changes to its pricing structure, and the free tier became a relic of the past. It was time to explore alternatives.

# Discovering Coolify

Coolify presented a revolutionary approach to deploying and administering web applications. The magic lay in its simplicity, which reminded me of the early days of Heroku. The platform allowed me to **manage multiple apps on a single server instance**, eliminating the need for multiple dynos or containers that can become expensive.

## Robust and Up-to-Date UI

Coolify's user interface (UI) is a standout feature that sets it apart from Dokku. The UI is not only robust but also up-to-date with modern design principles. It offers a seamless and intuitive experience, making app management, scaling, and configuration a breeze. In contrast, Dokku's UI may feel dated and less user-friendly, requiring more manual configuration and a steeper learning curve.

## Simplified Deployment

One of the key advantages of Coolify was its streamlined deployment process. With a single command, I could deploy my web applications without the complexities of configuring dynos or dealing with container orchestration. This not only saved time but also reduced the learning curve for anyone familiar with traditional server deployment, with auto deployment and even feature preview.

## Cost-Effective Administration

Coolify's cost-effectiveness is a breath of fresh air, especially for those on a tight budget. The single-server instance approach significantly reduced my hosting expenses compared to the pay-per-dyno model of Heroku. It was a welcomed change that allowed me to allocate more resources to improving my apps rather than just covering hosting costs.

## The All-in-One Solution

Coolify's single server instance model offers an all-in-one solution for deploying, administering, and maintaining web applications. I can easily manage my apps, databases, and domains from a unified interface. It simplifies the process, reducing the need for third-party add-ons and complex configurations.

Conclusion: Coolify, the New Companion for Side Projects
